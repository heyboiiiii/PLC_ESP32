//////ESP32-PLC//////

-Main code of the aplication
-it has a main.c file which contains the init and running of the esp32, while shows the estate of the running process in a lcd display 16x2(by i2c).
-


Features:
1- 4 digital optoacoplated inputs
2- 2 analogic aislated inputs
3- 3 relay outputs
4- 1 transistorizated output

5- http web server to show the state of the inputs and outputs at real time.





future:
1- Create a system to could upload the plc programs and the logic of the circuit will change at real time.
